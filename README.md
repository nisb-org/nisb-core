## Why Dual License?

NISB represents months of work creating a unique memory system with 
Hebbian learning and dynamic weight evolution. While we believe in 
open source, we also believe creators deserve compensation when 
large companies profit from their work.

**Our principle:** Individual users free, commercial users pay. 
It's fair, sustainable, and protects innovation.
